Chatbot has become an essential crowd puller in the world today and is used in various domains and professions. With increasing technologies and advancements in AI, components of voice assistance have been gaining prolific importance when integrated with chatbots. INTELLIBOT is a smart bot that not only interacts with its users through an interactive and aesthetic platform but also had added features for customized experience. It makes use of speech to text and text to speech processing to listen to the user and speak back to them. This project would give insights on the various applications of chatbots and existing systems along with the system we have proposed to overcome and curb the challenges posed by them through the INTELLIBOT framework. Further, this would elucidate the use of Na√Øve-Bayes algorithm and pattern matching algorithms for the same.
